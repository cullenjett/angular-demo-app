# You shouldn't be here...

### But since you are, here are a few things going on in this playground of an app:
- app.json is now called quickstart.config.js and (obviously) is no longer JSON.
- App structure has been changed up a bit to follow a more "folder-by-feature" direction.
- Javascript compilation errors no longer ruin your life. See javascript.js for deets.
- Browsersync opens automatically when you run 'gulp watch/local'.
- Ui Router instead of ngRouter
